Github Pages is a very good service with which users can host their personal webspace content and air it freely. Jekyll is a tool built on Ruby which converts markdown to traditional html files, which could be rendered by the browsers. If you are wondering, the index files etc are created by jekyll. So we don't need to know much html and other stuff. Developers have designed nice themes, and all we have to do is, install the theme and write some markdown. Markdown in actually easy and you cacn refer more from this [Github guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
