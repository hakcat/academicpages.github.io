- My interests (Academic): Machine Learning, Computer Vision.  
- My interests (Non-academic): Web designing, DIY electronic projects, Researching on Vedas and Indian culture (curently I'm studying astrology and vastu and I'm researching on ways to explain the science of our ancient cultural practises in a lucid way to the general public)

I manage my family (ancestral) website at [_Venmaranalloor Matom_](http://www.vedicfarm.in)
