Hi Earthling! Welcome to my cosmos and thanks for visiting!  

- Currently, I'm a B.Tech (Hons) undergraduate student in the Department of [Electronics and Communication Engineering](http://tkmce.ac.in/?department-info=electronics-communication-engineering) at [Kerala Technological University](https://ktu.edu.in/),   
{_[TKM College of Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thangal_Kunju_Musaliar_College_of_Engineering) Campus._}
- I love doing anything tech-related. I waste my time mostly in front of my computer, or with some other electronic gadgets.
- My non academic interests include Web designing, DIY electronic projects, researching on Vedas and Indian culture,etc.. (curently I'm studying astrology and vastu and I'm trying to relate them with the conventional western science, I was trained in school and college.)

I manage my family (ancestral) website at [_Venmaranalloor Matom_](http://www.vedicfarm.in)  
I write tech articles at [_TechynigGa_](http://www.techynig.ga)  
I also run a youtube channel at [_My Youtube Channel_](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5loeOXaEJqgJfLdVznb0xQ)
   
My favourite quotes:
>  “The more upto date knowledge you possess, the more freer you are.”
                                              - Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam
   
>  “Lives of great men remind us, we can make our lives sublime.”
                                        - Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (My grandfather used to quote me this)
   
>  “Aaal izz welll”
                                                - Phunsukh Wangudu (fictional character from 3 idiots)
